Call Inspector - iOS app for blocking and identifying phone calls & messages.

-Call Inspector uses CallKit and Call Directory Extension to process incoming calls.
-Call Inspector uses Message Filter Extension to process incoming SMS and MMS messages.

-Incoming calls are processed in a way that the phone numbers you set in your blocking list don't ring at all and the phone number you set in your identifying list show a message in incoming call screen which is for marketing purposes set to "Ex Girlfriend" :)

-Incoming messages are processed in a way that all phone numbers in you set in your filtering list are routed to "Junk" folder in your Messages.

-Adding new numbers
     -The idea is that you can't block and identify the same number because that doesn't make sense
     -Entered number must be in phone number format : + (country code) (phone number). There is a little extension that checks the correct format
     
-I tried to find something to get the phone number of incoming call but unsuccesfully for now. Could you give me a hint?

-I didn't do blocking everybody who ins't in your contacts beacuse you can easily do it in Settings :)

-UI is pretty simple, I'm not really a designer so it's just basic stuff

    Thanks! Call Inspector Team
